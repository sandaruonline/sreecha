            You may have noticed that while I'm doing something like listening to
            Spotify, programming in VSCode or playing a game, it'll appear in the
            bottom left of my site. This is thanks to an open-source project
      called <Link href={"https://lanyard.rest"}>Lanyard</Link> which pulls live presences from Discord and updates an API and WebSocket service. It takes {'<'}10 seconds to set up!
